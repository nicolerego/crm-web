<!-- <h2><span>About</span></h2>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (known to the Ruby community as DHH) is a Danish programmer and the creator of the popular Ruby on Rails web development framework. He is also a partner at the web-based software development firm 37signals. After attracting the attention of Jason Fried by offering him help with PHP coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based CRM tool, which ultimately became 37signals' Basecamp software as a service (SaaS) product. To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom web framework.</p>
